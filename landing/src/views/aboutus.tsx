      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        For more than 10 years, this club has been organizing soccer meetups and
        tournaments in the West Loop and Chicago South Side. We, your hosts
        Andre, Diego, Jordan and Julian are happy that you found us, and we aim
        to provide the best outdoors soccer pick up experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Games are competitive, but our community is very friendly to every
        player that aims to improve their skills. We match the teams as fairly
        as possible and expect to see you grow every weekend - iron sharpens
        iron.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we charge for every match, our prices are very low, just come
        have a good time. Chicago has often been considered a melting pot city
        for a long time now, and it's no stretch to say it shows in our game. No
        matter which side of the city you're showing up from, youâ€™re more than
        welcome to come kick it with us. Much like Chicago we have global reach
        too so shout out to the players from out of state and the worldwide
        soccer junkies who come out and play with us locals.
